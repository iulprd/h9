Hi Daniel, 

Good news just before the weekend. My colleague Gijs has found a way to export data from the Levi9 page. We have done so for four pages (Levi9, Levi9 Romania, Levi9 Ukraine and Levi9 Serbia).

Attached you will find the data on page and post level for every country. I have exported data from the last 180 days, because we can only export data for a timeframe of 180 days.

I have added the names per country in the file name otherwise I don't think you would know which file belonged to which country. If anything is unclear or you have other questions let me know!

I hope this gives you some extra data for the event, for now have a good weekend!




Met vriendelijke groet,
